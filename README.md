Histogram Method of Image Binarization Based on Fuzzy Pixel Representation

Abstract

The method used in image processing to separate the image as background and object is binarization. Well-Known method to binarizing image is Otsu Method. A promising direction in image processing is the use of fuzzy logic methods and the theory of fuzzy sets. In this project a new method of binarization using fuzzy pixel representation of an image based on fuzzy pixels. 
There are many known methods of fuzzy pixel representation. The membership functions for describing fuzzy pixels are discussed, and the requirements for
their form and appearance are given. A description of the new binarization method using histograms and a developed fuzzy representation of the image is presented. When the results were compared, it was seen that much better results were obtained compared to known methods.
